OTRA routing protocol
=====================

Description
-----------

The main goal is to design an application layer protocol that provides file transmission among hosts which are connected in a tree-shaped network. Each host offers the capability (service) of forwarding a file by consulting a routing table which maintains references to neighboring hosts (parent and children), then it decides the next hop toward the destination in the tree topology.

building and use
----------------

fast way to compile without an IDE
$ mkdir bin
$ find ./src -name *.java > sources_list.txt
$ javac -d bin/ @sources_list.txt

to run the application
$ cd bin
$ java app.Main -id <number> -interface <interface>

since we use two consoles (handle commands and operations debug printing), redirect std.err to a different tty.
on unix systems
$ java app.Main -id <number> -interface <if> 2> /dev/pts/<second_tty>
